\subsection*{About Me}
I am currently looking for work in Software Engineering/Computing field. I'm employed by Lockheed Martin Canada (LMC) as a Software Engineer. While in LMC I worked on the Halifax Class Modernization Project and my primary tasks were related to the Combat Management System 330. Most of my work at LMC was in Java 11 and maintaining legacy C libraries.

% My programming experience is with C/C++ and Python. I have created various data structures with C++ and used C++ to program on Robot Operating System. I used Python with Numpy and MatPlotLib with analyze data captured from oscilloscopes and various other sensors including ultrasonic and LiDAR. I have written PowerShell script and bash script and am comfortable working in a command line environment.

% I have developed on both Windows and Linux platform using various IDE's including Visual Studio, Eclipse and Emacs. I use git predominantly for version control. I know how to set up virtual environment with Oracle VirtualBox and will be comfortable with other virtual machines.

I have learned black box testing while working at Blackberry Ltd and Synaptive Medical. There I did scripted and exploratory testing to evaluate the stability of their products, and filing bug reports on JIRA. I have created benchmarks to do performance testing. I have learned Agile development practices.

I have good writing skills. I use LaTeX, Microsoft Office and other office software (LibreOffice/OpenOffice) to create reports and presentations. I have the ability to conduct research (from journals and other scholarly publications) and write academic/research papers.
